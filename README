This is a python module that plot bifurcation diagrams created by AUTO-07p (http://cmvl.cs.concordia.ca/auto/) in the ipython interactive notebook. I did this because the plotting modules that come with AUTO-07p use a different matplotlib backend to that used by the ipython notebook.

usage
in terminal:
ipython notebook --pylab inline

import auto as a
import as 'a' or something to avoid conflict with   

import AUTOgrapherNB as plt

the use AUTO-07p as normal
the to plot solution: plt.plotb(auto_soln,**kwargs) 
kwargs for plotting limits are xlim=[0.,0.1], ylim=[-1.,1.]
for axis x='P1', y='U4'
where 'P1' = PAR(1), 'U1'=U(1), 'T1'=PERIOD, 'L2'=L2-NORM
for stability: stable=='True'

for solutions use plots: plt.plots(r2("PD2"),**kwargs)
current kwargs are x,y ='U1' etc and xlim and ylim as before

take x,y data for plotting in standard notebook: plt.datab(x,y) where as above we use the kwargs. datab will return two arrays
usage x,y=plt.datab(x='P1',y='P2')
